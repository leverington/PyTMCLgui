# PyTMCLgui
a python Tkinter gui for operating a TMCL/Trinamic stepping motor.

The TMCL library is from https://github.com/ap--/PyStepRocker by Andreas Poehlmann, a Python TMCL interface for the StepRocker stepper motor driver

The code here currently works for a TMCM-110-42 controller driver attached to a PD2-110-42-232 stepper motor over a Serial to USB on Windows and Python 2.7

#script
python.exe .\PyTMCLgui.py
